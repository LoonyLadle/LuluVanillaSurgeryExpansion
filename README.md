# Lulu's Vanilla Surgery Expansion
 Adds additional prosthetics that should have been in the core game.

## Like what?
* Bionic jaws, kidneys, livers, and lungs.
* Prosthetic eyes.
* Hook hands.
* Natural stomachs. 

## Why no prosthetic organs?

Prosthetics represent industrial-era technology, which cannot replicate the functioning of some natural organs. Modern prosthetic "lungs" and "kidneys" are large external machines. A prosthetic kidney is known as a dialysis machine, and a prosthetic lung is known as an artificial lung and carted around in a large backpack. Prosthetic organs beyond those in the core game did not seem appropriate for the technology level.

The exception was prosthetic eyes, which are a fairly straightforward extension of existing cochlear implant technology that has already enjoyed limited success in the modern world.

## Why no archotech organs?

There are no archotech internal organs in the base game. This actually makes sense from a game design prospective; archotech parts are extraordinarily expensive but augmenting most internal organs gives only fairly paltry enhancements to a pawn's capacities. Poor blood pumping may reduce consciousness, but improving blood pumping does not see a corresponding increase. Archotech only really makes sense for parts that are used in virtually everything; manipulation and moving. Even archotech eyes are debatable in their worthwhileness.

If you need a lore reason, consider that the archotech super-AIs responsible for creating these items would probably prefer their handiwork be visible.
