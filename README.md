# Lulu's Vanilla Surgery Expansion
 Adds additional prosthetics that should have been in the core game.

## Like what?
* Bionic jaws, kidneys, livers, and lungs.
* Prosthetic eyes.
* Hook hands.
* Natural stomachs. 

Prosthetics represent industrial-era technology, which cannot replicate the functioning of some natural organs. Modern prosthetic "lungs" and "kidneys" are large external machines. Bionics have no such excuse. There are no archotech internal organs; presumably the super-AIs responsible prefer their handiwork be visible.
